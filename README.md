# Battle ships

Simple battle ships game made in python using pygame

## Running the game

* clone the repo

* run `python battle_game.py`

## Rules

* Place your ships on the left game field
* ships can only be placed horizontally or vertically, no cornering
* there should be 1x5, 1x4, 1x3, 2x2 and 2x1 squares ships
* When all ships are placed correctly, click `Start game`
* Start clicking on the enemy's field to see whether you hit or miss
* players (human and computer) shoot in turns, one by one
* The player which sinks all the enemy's ships first wins
